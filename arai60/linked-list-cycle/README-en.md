## Consideration
- I have solved this before.
- Prepare two pointers with different speeds (in my mind, I think of a hare and a tortoise):
    - Slow pointer: moves one step at a time.
    - Fast pointer: moves two steps at a time.
    - If the fast pointer reaches the end, there is no cycle.
    - Otherwise, the fast pointer will eventually catch up with the slow pointer.
- Edge cases:
    - If the list is empty, return false.
    - If the list has only one element, return false.
- Implementation comes next.

## Step 1
- Take care that if fast.next is None, fast.next.next cannot be read.
- Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1).

## Step 2
- Simplified the initialization of fast and slow using tuple unpacking.
- Reviewed the while loop condition:
    - Changed the stopping condition to when fast or fast.next becomes None.
    - If fast.next becomes None, it means there is no cycle.

## Step 3
- 1st attempt: 47 seconds.
- 2nd attempt: 46 seconds.
- 3rd attempt: 45 seconds.

## Step 4
- Modified the code based on the review.
- Removed unnecessary conditional branches.
    - Fewer branches reduce complexity for the reader.
- Split the initialization process into two lines.
    - Although it is fine in this case, if there are many variables to initialize, the correspondence becomes unclear.
    - To maintain consistency, I decided to write them in multiple lines (creating my own rule).
